    <h2>Adumirira's 4 Realms</h2>
    <p>The world was broken to save it, but now it was slowly killing it. Slowly the corrupted magic is leaking out of its prison realm, trying to claim everything in its path. Hundreds of years later though the realms are slowly starting to crack and if someone doesn't do something about it quickly they will completely shatter. Branson and Avalia had just wanted their friend Hazel back, but find themselves on an adventure with the protector of the Scholar realm to save their world before it's too late. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Avalia</dt>
        <dd>As a child, Avalia met Branson and Hazel. When the Herald reappeared to orchestrate the "accident" that sent Hazel to the Nexus, Avalia's wild magic flared up, leading Branson to blame her for the disaster. This left the teenage Avalia living in isolation, wracked with "survivor's guilt" and believing her very nature is dangerous to those she loves—not realizing she is actually a hidden queen whose "impure" blood is the key to saving the world.
</dd>
        <dt>Branson</dt>
        <dd>Branson's life was destroyed in a single window of time. First, he witnessed the magical accident where Hazel vanished into the Nexus (a disaster he blamed on Avalia's wild magic). Shortly after, his parents died in a tragic car accident. Left entirely alone, he was vulnerable and broken.Branson now lives a double life. He is Martok's "Golden Boy" and chief researcher, but he is secretly racing his uncle to find the "Key" to the Nexus. He stays with Martok not out of loyalty, but out of a deep-seated fear that if he betrays his uncle, he will be truly alone again. </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>To save the world it was broken into 4 realms. The realms include the primal realm, somatic realm, scientific realm, and the fear realm.</p>
