    <h1>Who Were the Signers</h1>
    <h2>Famous Signers</h2>
    <p>While 56 delegates eventually signed the document, a few names stand out because of their massive influence on the founding of the United States—or, in one case, the sheer size of their handwriting.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Thomas Jefferson</dt>
        <dd>Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, was the principal author of the Declaration of Independence. He later served as the 3rd President of the United States and is remembered for his contributions to American ideals of liberty and democracy.</dd>
        <dt>John Adams</dt>
        <dd>John Adams, representing massachusetts, was a vocal advocate for independence in the continental Congress. He became the 2nd President of the United States and played a key role in drafting foundational documents and promoting the cause of freedom.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>A Quick Correction: Many people assume George Washington signed the Declaration. He actually didn't! At the time, he was already in New York City leading the Continental Army, preparing for the British invasion.</p>
